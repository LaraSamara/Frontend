                    of
                    physics and chemistry. The field applics laws of
                    different subjects like thermodynamies, molecular physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This
                    book unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics, which will be crucial for the holistic
                    understanding of the subject matter.</td>
